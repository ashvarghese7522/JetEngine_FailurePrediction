Predictive Maintenance Using Machine Learning
Project Overview This project aims to predict Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of jet engines using sensor data from the NASA CMAPSS dataset. By implementing machine learning techniques, the project helps in predictive maintenance by forecasting engine failures before they occur, reducing downtime and maintenance costs.

Dataset Source: NASA CMAPSS Dataset

Data Type: Time-series sensor readings from multiple jet engines

Features: 21 engine health indicators (temperature, pressure, fan speed, etc.)

Target: Remaining Useful Life (RUL)

Technologies Used Programming Language: Python

Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Machine Learning: Scikit-learn (Random Forest, Linear Regression)

Deep Learning: TensorFlow/Keras (LSTM for time-series prediction)

Model Evaluation: RMSE, MAE

Deployment: Streamlit, Flask (optional)

Approach & Methodology Data Preprocessing:

Handled missing values and normalized sensor data.

Engine run cycles were structured for sequential modeling.

Feature Engineering:

Created rolling averages, moving standard deviations, and trend-based features.

Modeling:

Compared traditional ML models (Random Forest, Linear Regression) with deep learning (LSTM).

Evaluation & Optimization:

Fine-tuned hyperparameters and evaluated models using RMSE & MAE.

Deployment (Optional):

Built a Streamlit dashboard to visualize RUL predictions.

Results Achieved XX% accuracy in predicting engine failures.

Reduced maintenance costs by XX% in simulated test cases.

ðŸ“Œ Future Improvements Integrate real-time sensor data streaming Deploy the model as a REST API Improve model accuracy using advanced deep learning techniques
